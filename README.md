# PCB-Xmas-tree

A creative PCB design of a Xmas Tree.
This is my version from a PCB Xmas Tree. You can check how it works on my youtube channel. You can also download the Gerber file and find more details there. Check it out!

I designed this PCB Christmas tree using EasyEDA software and then ordered it online from [*JLCPCB*](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=RMW)
