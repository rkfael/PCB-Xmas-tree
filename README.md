# PCB-Xmas-tree

A creative PCB design of a Xmas Tree.
This is my version from a PCB Xmas Tree. You can check how it works on my youtube channel. You can also verify the Gerber file to download and more. Check it out!

I made this PCB Christmas tree using the *EasyEDA* software and then ordered it online at <https://jlcpcb.com/IRG>
